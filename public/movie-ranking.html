<h1>The Best Movies According to Steve</h1>
<h2>My current 3 favorites</h2>
<hr />
<h1>Super Mario Bros</h1>
<p>It's Super Mario Bros brought to life in glorious CGI!</p>
<h1>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</h1>
<p>Low-budget fantasy comedy that embraces the low-budget part and makes it a part of the film.</p>
<h1>The Princess Bride</h1>
<p>As close to a perfect movie as I've ever seen.</p>
